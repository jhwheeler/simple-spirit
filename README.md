## Usage

Simple Spirit is a space for you to listen to the silence.

Each koan is an opportunity for you to soak in the sounds and meditate on the silence embracing them. By clicking on "make it real", an inquiry appears: a practical exercise for you to apply the koan's wisdom in your daily life.

A "Write" button also appears below the inquiry. In the textarea that opens up, you can write everything and anything that comes to mind. By pressing "Clear", your words will be cleared away. They are not saved in any database and will not be accessible to you or anyone else, for the goal of this exercise is not to accumulate and gather words/thoughts/objects, but rather to reduce the burden of such thoughts.

Just as you may write a wish and throw it in a fire, this is an opportunity for you to work on letting go and freeing up.
