* can adjust push notification settings: frequency, type, etc.
* can follow a tool to an article, book, or other external resource to deepen my understanding of the why and how behind it
* can record my experience of a certain tool through text, video, or audio
* can share that experience, aphorism, and/or tool on social media
* can enter a forum where I can share and learn from others' experiences
* am called to act on the Challenge of the Day/Week, an opportunity for me to use the daily toolsto create an end result that I can then share on the forum and/or social media. There is a contest with prizes that inspire me and my fellow to complete the challenge.
